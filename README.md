# Microbiome-analysis-in-high-dimensional
Compositional data (CoDa) consist of a collection of nonnegative measurements that sum to a constant value, 
typically, proportions that sum to 1. Because knowing the sum, one component can be determined from the sum of
the remainder, the parts that make up the composition are mathematically and statistically dependent. This distinct
structure complicates analysis and does not allow standard statistical analyses. Aitchison (JRSS-B, 1982) and 
Egozcue and colleagues (Math. Geol., 2003), among others, provided a framework to analyze CoDa by mapping data from
the constrained simplex space to the Euclidian space using nonlinear transforms such as the log-odds or the isometric
log-ratio transforms.    
The increasing quality/reducing cost of high-throughput sequencing technology, in particular, 16S rRNA gene sequencing 
of the bacterial component of the community, has enabled researchers to investigate human diseases. Subsequently,
microbiota has been associated with numerous diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, cancer
and cystic fibrosis. Because of the compositional structure and the high-dimensional data generated by microbiota sequencing,
there is also a parallel development of specific statistical analysis methods and computational tools.   

The human microbial communities (microbiota) are usually measured as relative abundance of species and analyzed as CoDa.

The objectives of this work are the following:
